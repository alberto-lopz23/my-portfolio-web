                        <p>This house was built in 1985 by architect Alberto L. Checo. The house was designed so that
                            the family could live in a cozy and comfortable environment. Checo wanted this house to
                            endure over the years as a center of architectural perfection. </p>

                        <h3>Albert L. Checo</h3>
                        <p>He was born in the Dominican Republic in a small town. Since he was a child, with a love for
                            architecture and drawings, he designed countless architectural works, but none like this
                            house, which was very modern for the time. Even now, it is still very modern.</p>
